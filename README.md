This is a test demo of our unprinted paper *Weighted Regularization Method Based on Reduced Biquaternion Complex Modulus*

Here is a briefly introduction of how to run this demo:

1. Be sure your OS support Python3 and already installed NumPy and Matplotlib.
2. Open a terminal and input

  ```python
  python plot.py
  ```

3. Wait a while and there will display 4 heatmap which is the result of our first experiment in the paper.

The detailed training evaluation result could be found in `./mnist_*/exp-*/log.npy`
